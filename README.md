# Contiki BBS
Contiki BBS is a tiny, little and text based bulletin board system (BBS) for the Commodore 64 homecomputer and a compatible ethernet cartridge (e.g. TFE, RRnet, 64NIC+). It will also run in a VICE emulator with ethernet support enabled. The BBS itself can be accessed through a standard telnet connection.
