# Contiki BBS
Contiki BBS is a tiny, little and text based bulletin board system (BBS) server for the Commodore 64 homecomputer and a compatible ethernet cartridge (e.g. TFE, RRnet, 64NIC+). It will also run in a VICE emulator with ethernet support enabled. The BBS itself can be accessed through a standard telnet connection. Despite a floppy disk drive and the ethernet cartridge no further addon hardware is required (for emulation  get VICE with ethernet support).
